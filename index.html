            Living with Cognitive Challenges: My Journey with Lower Intelligence

        <main>
            <p>Before we begin, I want to clarify that I’ll be using the term 'IQ' in a more abstract sense throughout this article. Rather than its traditional and scientific definition, I’m referring to it as the idea of general of intelligence.</p>
            <p>For a long time, my goal was to buy empathy and understanding from others. But now, what i really want is to state the truth and be authentic about my experiences. There is a part of me that still clings to the hope that my cognitive challenges might not be as significant as they seem, that perhaps I am 'normal' after all. This lingering doubt is something I need to address.
            </p>
            <p>This article is written not just for others but primarily for myself. It is an attempt to confront and accept the reality of my intelligence and to come to terms with it once and for all. By sharing my journey, I hope to settle these thoughts, gain clarity, and finally move on with my life.</p>
            <p>I also want to acknowledge that this article has been polished with the help of AI tools. I’ve made some adjustments to ensure it reflects my voice and style. I’m not ashamed of this, as I recognize that without this technology, expressing myself fully would have been much more challenging due to my writing limitations caused by my lack of intelligence.</p>

            <p>Instead of listing the challenges I face, I will walk through my life and highlight specific moments that reveal signs of mental challenges. I’ll discuss how these issues affected me at the time and how they continue to impact me today.</p>
            <p>I was born on October 10, 2005, in the capital of Iran. Many of my family members recall that I took significantly longer to start walking and talking compared to a typical child. Although I wasn't completely silent, I often made sounds in an attempt to replicate speech, but my efforts were largely unsuccessful for a long time.</p>
            <p>As I moved into early childhood, I didn’t have any friends and spent about 90 percent of my day in front of the TV, mindlessly watching cartoons. While many children do spend a lot of time watching TV, my experience was particularly extreme. My imagination, if it existed at all, was quite limited. It felt more like passive media consumption rather than the vivid, creative play typically associated with childhood. When I did try to imagine things, I could only come up with simple shapes, lacking the depth and complexity of more developed imaginative play.</p>
            <p>School wasn't a positive experience for me either. I was a social outcast, not due to shyness, but because my attempts to socialize were largely unsuccessful. I spent the first three years of school isolated, and even after transferring to a new school, the situation remained unchanged. In fact, I became more annoying to others, which led to increased hostility. I was bullied by nearly everyone.</p>
            <p>I felt different from other children in that my mind was empty and passions. I lacked enthusiasm for anything specific and didn't excel in any particular area. I struggled with drawing, performed poorly academically, and generally felt as though I wasn’t good at anything. In essence, I was unable to identify any talents or skills that set me apart.</p>
            <p>Up until now, I had no passions or interests—nothing that truly captivated me, i didn't watch movies, television i could not enjoy art and i didn't listen to music. I also experienced a sense of emotional numbness, unable to feel any real or profound emotions.</p>
            <p>When I was 12, I attempted to gain attention by acting like a literal baby, even going as far as to cry for attention. I was fully aware that I felt nothing—no stress or anxiety—and that my behavior was merely an act. Unfortunately, this approach backfired, leading to even more bullying and further isolation.</p>
            <p>In middle school, things took an interesting turn. Feeling empty and navigating puberty, I became a chameleon, adapting my behavior to blend in with those around me. I pretended to care about things I wasn't truly passionate about and mimicked others, often drawing from influences on the internet. This created a false persona that would soon unravel. During this stage of my life, I struggled with basic tasks. I was so incompetent that I couldn't even cook an egg despite numerous attempts. Walking remained a challenge, and my grades were consistently low. I spent hours grappling with simple concepts that I couldn’t easily grasp. I had no distinct personality, struggled with cooking and cleaning, had issues with choosing appropriate clothing, and faced difficulties making even simple decisions. Even in video games, I was the worst performer and struggled with logical thinking and experienced low sexual tention.</p>
            <p>I also struggled to understand why people connect with art, music, movies, and similar forms of expression. I’m not exaggerating when I say that it wasn’t until a year ago that I realized the reason: it’s because they experience an emotional and intellectual connection to these things.</p>
            <p>Despite my low grades and barely functional brain, I somehow got accepted into a school for gifted children (SAMPAD). The first person I talked to was a math enthusiast, so I shifted from whatever Frankenstein mess I was to a math lover. I spent 10 to 12 hours learning math, which, not going to lie, improved my grades. But no matter how much I tried, I could not pass a barrier; I wasn't improving anymore.</p>
            <p>Most of tenth and eleventh grades went by in a similar fashion. Reflecting back, I realize that I was quite awkward in conversations. During one-on-one interactions, my mind would often lock up, and I exhibited a lot of childlike behavior, as if I were still 13 years old. I was perpetually confused and struggled to navigate social situations.</p>
            <p>I must emphasize that I was really fucking confused, but everything changed when I met someone who profoundly impacted me. Although it might sound sentimental, I'm not entirely sure if what I experienced was love or just my brain trying to troubleshoot and fix itself. I was no longer numb; I began to care about things, or at least I thought I did. I questioned whether it was just a deeper level of pretending, but I genuinely cared about that person and still do. I remain fascinated by them, even though I struggled to understand them fully, as I often felt like I understood nothing. This emotional rollercoaster made me realize what was wrong with me, and for this, I thank them from the bottom of my heart for just existing.</p>
            <p>I’ve reached an academic barrier where I feel unable to learn anything new. At this rate, I might have to drop out of college just after my first year, and I have little hope of finding a job or establishing a real career. I feel worthless and see no point in life. I often contemplate suicide, but I lack the courage to act on these thoughts. If my fears come true and I end up having to move back in with my parents, I would rather not face that reality and instead shoot myself in the head. For now, I’m still here, feeling as if I’m not even alive.</p>
